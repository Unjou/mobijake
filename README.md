A powerful tool to automatically check the quality of machine-translated visual novel scripts. It finds common errors, leftover Japanese text, and other weird stuff, saving you hours of boring manual work.

## 🌟 Cool Features

-   **🧠 Smart Line Matching:**
    -   Stops relying on line numbers that are always messed up after translation.
    -   Understands common line markers like `p1`, `p2`, `l1`, etc.
    -   If there are no markers, it uses a clever content-similarity trick to match the right lines together.

-   **⚡ Blazing Fast Scanning:**
    -   Processes multiple files at the same time (multi-threading).
    -   Cuts down scanning time from hours to just a few minutes, even for huge projects.

-   **💾 Smart Translation Cache:**
    -   Remembers translations from DeepL/Google Translate in a file.
    -   The next time you scan, it won't re-translate the same sentence. It's instant.

-   **🔍 Finds All the Common Problems:**
    -   **Not Translated:** Catches empty lines that were skipped.
    -   **JP Chars Leftover:** Spots Japanese characters (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji) that weren't translated.
    -   **Pronoun Errors:** Flags things like translating '彼女' (she) as 'he'.
    -   **Anomalous Symbols:** Finds weird symbols like `[]` or `"""` that are out of place.
    -   **Too Formal:** Points out words like "therefore" or "henceforth" that sound unnatural in dialogue.

-   **💡 Gives You Better Translations:**
    -   For every problem it finds, it automatically suggests a better translation using DeepL/Google Translate.

-   **🖥️ Easy-to-Use Interface:**
    -   A clean table shows you all the problems, with the bad parts highlighted.
    -   Use filters to only see specific errors (e.g., only "Pronoun Errors").
    -   Export all the findings to a `.csv` file with one click.

## 🤔 Why This Tool?

Let's be real, manual QC sucks. It's boring, takes forever, and you'll always miss something. This tool does the soul-crushing part for you. It finds the mistakes so you can focus on actually improving the translation and making it sound good.

## 📁 What It Works With

This is built mainly for the **Kirikiri/Kirikiri2 Engine**, but it's flexible enough for other text-based scripts.

-   **File Extensions:** `.ks`, `.tjs`, `.txt`, `.ks.scn`, `.txt.scn`
-   **Line Marker Patterns It Knows:**
    -   `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, ...
    -   `l1`, `l2`, `l3`, ...
    -   `msg1`, `dialog1`, `line1`, etc.
    -   And formats like: `[p1]`, `// p1:`, `p1 =`, and so on.

## 🚀 How to Get It Running

### What You Need

-   Python 3.6 or newer.
-   `pip` (usually comes with Python).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JPLeftoverHunter.git
    cd JPLeftoverHunter
    ```

2.  **Install the Stuff It Needs:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` and paste this into it:
    ```
    PyQt5==5.15.9
    chardet==5.1.0
    deep-translator==1.11.4
    ```
    Then run this in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    python JPLeftoverHunter.pyw
    ```

## 📖 How to Use It

1.  **Get Your Folders Ready:**
    -   **JP Folder:** The original Japanese scripts.
    -   **MTL Folder:** The machine-translated scripts.

2.  **Open the App:** Run `JPLeftoverHunter.pyw`.

3.  **Set It Up:**
    -   Click the 📁 button to select your **JP Folder**.
    -   Click the other 📁 button to select your **MTL Folder**.
    -   Choose the **Target Language** for suggestions (e.g., English or Indonesian).

4.  **Hit Scan:** Click the 🔍 button and grab a coffee. It'll be done before you know it.

5.  **Check the Results:**
    -   The table will fill up with every problem it found.
    -   Use the **Filter** dropdown to look at just one type of error.
    -   Hover over any cell to see more details.

6.  **Export:** Click the 💾 button to save everything to a `.csv` file.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Gist)

1.  **Reads Files:** It reads all your scripts and pulls out only the dialogue, ignoring the engine's code.
2.  **Matches Lines:** It uses its smart matching logic to pair each Japanese line with its translated version.
3.  **Analyzes:** It checks each pair for all the common problems listed above, and it does this for many files at once.
4.  **Gets Suggestions:** If it finds a problem, it asks DeepL/Google for a better translation and saves the result.
5.  **Reports:** It shows you everything in a nice, clean table.
